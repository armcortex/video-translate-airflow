 Hey everyone, welcome to the LatentSpace podcast.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,180
 This is Swix, writer and editor of LatentSpace, and Alessio is taking over with the intros

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,800
 Alessio's partner and CTO and residents at Decibel Partners.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,600
 Hey everyone, today we have GeoHot on the podcast, aka George Hotz for the human name.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,680
 Everybody knows George, so I'm not going to do a big intro.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,260
 A couple of things that people might have missed.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,040
 So you were the first to unlock the iPhone.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,880
 You traded the first ever unlocked iPhone for a Nissan 350Z and three new iPhones.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,620
 You were then one of the first people to break into the PS3 around arbitrary code.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,600
 You got sued by Sony, you wrote a rap song to fight against that, which is still live

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,120
 on YouTube, which we're going to have on the show notes.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,440
 Then you did not go to Tesla to build vision, and instead you started Comii, which was an

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,960
 amazing engineering feat in itself until you got a disease from the government to not put

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,200
 these things on the street, turned that into a research only project.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
 You know they're out there.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,800
 Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, they're out there, but they're not a, you market them as a research

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 kind of like no warranty.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,280
 Because I use the word dev kit, that's not about the government.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,640
 It has nothing to do with the government.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,720
 We offer a great one year warranty.

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,680
 The truth about that is it's gatekeeping.
