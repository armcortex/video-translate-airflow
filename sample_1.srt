 Hey everyone, today we have GeoHot on the podcast, aka George Hotz for the human name.

 Everybody knows George, so I'm not going to do a big intro.

 A couple of things that people might have missed.

00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,040
 So you were the first to unlock the iPhone.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,880
 You traded the first ever unlocked iPhone for a Nissan 350Z and three new iPhones.

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,620
 You were then one of the first people to break into the PS3 around arbitrary code.

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,600
 You got sued by Sony, you wrote a rap song to fight against that, which is still live
